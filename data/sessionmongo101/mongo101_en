For all of you interested in NoSQL, Maxime will present us MongoDB - a document oriented NoSQL database. 

Max, will briefly go through: "What is a NoSQL database?", "How does it compare to relational databases (such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, etc.)?" and "What different types of NoSQL databases are there?". 

He will delve into some characteristics of MongoDB such as JSON documents, GridFS, GIS (Geographic Information System), Aggregation Framework, etc.

If you've ever wondered what is NoSQL or MongoDB (or both) and how you can take advantage of these technologies do not hesitate to come and enjoy Max's presentation.
The presentation will be given in French (Questions may be asked in English).
